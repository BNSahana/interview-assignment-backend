Create a web application that facilitates the submission and display of code snippets. The application should consist of two pages:

Page 1: Construct a form to gather the following fields: username, preferred code language (C++, Java, JavaScript, Python), standard input (stdin), and the source code.

Page 2: Present all submitted entries in a tabular format, showcasing the username, code language, stdin, and timestamp of submission. Additionally, limit the display of the source code to the initial 100 characters.

The application must function seamlessly with data stored in a database. Both the front-end and back-end applications need to be hosted.
